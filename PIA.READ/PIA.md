# Header For the PIA

## For my PIA i will do a code base on an movie theater, where you choose your sit and the other systems
Like this:

## How will do a similar system?
Base on the code of the minesweeper, instead of planting a bomb in an random place I will give that space as "occupied"
and will also tell which sits are empty so then they will be ocuppied. To do this i have to know how to use bidimensional
matrixÂ´s .
Also do the part where u buy ur ticket to see the movie, show how much u spend on snacks.

## Logic
Use fucntions to separate each part of the program so it can be repeated several times.
